        <h3 class="">Co-living with healthy community</h3>
        <p1 class="Paragraph-1">Co-living with a healthy community refers to a housing concept that emphasizes communal living and 
            promotes a healthy and supportive lifestyle among its residents. It involves individuals or groups of 
            people living together in a shared space while actively engaging in activities and practices that enhance 
            their physical, mental, and social well-being.
        </p1>
        <p2 class="Paragraph-2">The concept of co-living with a healthy community prioritizes communal spaces that foster socialization 
            and connection among residents. It is designed in such a way that the layout is conducive to social 
            interaction, with spaces that allow for both privacy and interaction; outdoor spaces where residents can 
            come together to interact and collaborate.
        </p2>
        <p3 class="Paragraph-3">
            <li>Designed in such a way that every home gets sufficient light and ventilation by Considering 
                sun path. </li>
            <li>Road networks are made safe by providing streetlights and separating walkways from vehicular 
                access. </li>
            <li>Centrally placed community spaces in housing areas so that social interaction and collaboration 
                becomes easy.</li> 
            <li>Land is provided for local foods and planting. </li>
            <li>Commercial buildings provide an area for income generation where people can sell their 
                products.</li>
        </p3>
        <p4 class="Paragraph-4">Considering the sun path diagram, the site is divided into two patterns i.e., radial pattern and grid iron 
            pattern. The roads are designed in such a way that the main road connects three different components 
            of the site i.e., the entrance, apartment and children park as well as providing connection to the grid iron 
            pattern. Near to the entrance, there is a commercial building providing facilities for grocery stores, 
            pharmacy, cafes etc. it is placed near to the entrance so that outsiders also get benefitted. Near to the 
            commercial building there is community building which composes of gym hall, swimming pool, 
            multipurpose hall, training hall etc. training halls are provided so that interested housewives can learn 
            skill-based work.
